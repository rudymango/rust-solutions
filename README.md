## hello
Just a simple program that prints out "Hello, world!".

## echor
An implementation of the standard "echo" command.

## catr
So far, this command replicates some of the functionalities of the "cat" command. At this point, it cannot write to files, but it can read from them. There are different flags to number the amount of lines and whatnot.

## headr
Similar to catr, this is a program that can be used to read the first ten lines of code by default. The modifiers -c and -n can be used to display the contents of such a file through byte size and line count likewise.
