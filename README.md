## hello
Just a simple program that prints out "Hello, world!".

## echor
An implementation of the standard "echo" command.

## catr
So far, this command replicates some of the functionalities of the "cat" command. At this point, it cannot write to files, but it can read from them. There are different flags to number the amount of lines and whatnot.
